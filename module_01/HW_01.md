## Problems [Part 1](./01_Interacting_with_Python.md)

1. Calculate some properties of a rectangular box that is 12.5"$\times$11"$\times$14" and weighs 31 lbs

    a. What is the volume of the box?
    
    b. What is the average density of the box?
    
    c. What is the result of the following logical operation, `volume>1000` (in inches^3)

+++

The volume of a box is calculated by doing the length x width x height of the box. The density is calculated by doing mass divided by volume.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#a). Volume of a Rectangular Box 12.5" x 11" x 14"
length = 12.5 #inches 
width = 11 #inches
height = 14 #inches
volume = length * width * height #in^3

#b). Average Density of the Rectangular Box
mass = 31 #lbs
density = mass/volume #lbs/in^3

print(volume)
print(density)

#c). Logical Operation
print(volume > 1000)
```

The volume of the rectangular box is 1925 lbs.
The density of the rectangular box is lb/in^3.
The logical operation will return True since 1925lbs is more than 1000lbs.

+++

2. Use the variables given below, `str1` and `str2`, and check the following 

    a. `str1<str2`
    
    b. `str1==str2`
    
    c. `str1>str2`
    
    d. How could you force (b) to be true? [Hint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str.lower#str.lower) or [Hint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str.lower#str.upper)

```{code-cell} ipython3
str1 = 'Python'
str2 = 'python'
#a). 
print(str1 < str2) #check if string one is less than string two
#b).
print(str1 == str2) #check if the strings are equal
#c). 
print(str1 > str2) #check is string one is more than string two
#d). 
str1 = str1.lower()
print(str1 == str2)
```

String one is less than string two and string one is not more than string two. They are not not equal to each other since the P in string one is uppercase but we can make them equal to each other by using the str.lower() command which would make the p lowercase. Using this command, the strings are now equal.

+++

3. The following code has an error, fix the error so that the correct result is returned:

```y is 20 and x is less than y```

```python
x="1"
y=20

if x<y and y==20:
    print('y is 20 and x is less than y')
else:
    print('x is not less than y')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#y is 20 and x is less than y

x = 1 #needs to be an integer
y = 20

if x < y and y == 20:
    print('y is 20 and x is less than y')
else:
    print('x is not less than y')
```

The error in this code occurs because the x variable is a string and not an integer. A string type can not be compared to an integer type. In order to fix this error, we can make the x variable an integer.

+++

4. There is a commonly-used programming question that asks interviewees
   to build a [fizz-buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) result. 
   
   Here, you will build a similar program, but use the numbers from the
   class, **3255:** $3,~2,~5\rightarrow$ "computational", "mechanics",
   "rocks!". You should print out a list of numbers, if the number is
   divisible by 3, replace the 3 with "computational". If the number is
   divisible by 2, replace with "mechanics". If the number is divisible
   by 5, replace the number with "rocks!". If the number is divisible by
   a combination, then add both words e.g. 6 is divisible by 3 and 2, so
   you would print out "computational mechanics". 
   
   Here are the first 20 outputs your program should print, 
   
| index | printed output |
| ---   | ---            |
0 | Computational Mechanics Rocks!
1 | 1
2 | Mechanics 
3 | Computational 
4 | Mechanics 
5 | Rocks!
6 | Computational Mechanics
7 | 7
8 | Mechanics 
9 | Computational 
10 | Mechanics Rocks!
11 | 11
12 | Computational Mechanics
13 | 13
14 | Mechanics 
15 | Computational Rocks!
16 | Mechanics 
17 | 17
18 | Computational Mechanics
19 | 19

```{code-cell} ipython3
def fizz_buzz(number): #defined a functions
    '''Determines if a number is divisble by 3, 2, and/or 5 and returns the correct statement'''
    if (number % 3 == 0 ) and (number % 2 == 0) and (number % 5 == 0): #if statements to determine what numbers the input is divisble by 
        return "Computational Mechanics Rocks!"
    elif (number % 3 == 0) and (number % 2== 0): #elif statements to code for every possibility 
        return "Computatial Mechanics"
    elif (number % 3 == 0) and (number % 5 == 0):
        return "Computational Rocks!"
    elif (number % 2 == 0) and (number % 5 == 0):
        return "Mechanics Rocks!"
    elif (number % 3 == 0):
        return "Computational"
    elif (number % 2 == 0):
        return "Mechanics"
    elif (number % 5 == 0):
        return "Rocks!"
    else:
        return number

for i in range(20):
    print(fizz_buzz(i)) #print out the results of the first 19
    
```

## Problems [Part 2](./02_Working_with_Python.md)

1. Create a function called `sincos(x)` that returns two arrays, `sinx` and `cosx` that return the sine and cosine of the input array, `x`. 

    a. Document your function with a help file in `'''help'''`
    
    b. Use your function to plot sin(x) and cos(x) for x=$0..2\pi$

+++

# Revision is made here to plot outside function

```{code-cell} ipython3
def sincos(x):
    '''Returns the sine and cosine arrays of an inputted number.
    1a). Documents the function and b). plots the function from 0 to 2pi
    '''
    sinx = np.sin(x) #create an array using sine function
    cosx = np.cos(x) #create an array using cosine function
    return sinx, cosx #returns sinx and cosx

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi) #plots from 0 to 2pi
sinx, cosx = sincos(x)
plt.plot(x, sinx)
plt.plot(x, cosx)
plt.legend() #puts a legend on the graph
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#1b) Document using help file
sincos?
```

2. Use a for-loop to create a variable called `A_99`, where every element is the product
of the two indices from 0 to 9 e.g. A_99[3,2]=6 and A_99[4,4]=16. 

    a. time your script using `%%time`    
    
    b. Calculate the mean of `A_99`

    c. Calculate the standard deviation of `A_99`

```{code-cell} ipython3
#2a) Time Script Using Time
%time
A_99=[] #Assigned A_99 to an empty list so numbers can be added into it 
for i in range(10): 
    for j in range(10): #makes an array of numbers 0-9
        A_99.append(i*j) #multiple the numbers in the arrays to create A_99

#2b) mean calculation
summation = np.sum(A_99)
length = len(A_99) #length of the list
mean = summation/length #mean is the sum of all the values divided 
print(mean)

#2c) standard deviation calculation
square = [] #collection of all the values minus the mean squared
for i in A_99:
    combine = (i - mean)**2 #values minus the mean squared 
    square.append(combine)
total = np.sum(square)/length #sums all the squares
standard_deviation = math.sqrt(total) #calculation of standard deivation 
print(standard_deviation)
```

The mean of the data is 20.25 and the standard deviation is 20.05.

+++

3. Use the two arrays, X and Y, given below to create A_99 using numpy array math rather than a for-loop.

```{code-cell} ipython3
X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(10), np.arange(10))
```

    a. time your script using `%%time`    
    
    b. Calculate the mean of `A_99`

    c. Calculate the standard deviation of `A_99`
        
    d. create a filled contour plot of X, Y, A_99 [contourf plot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.contourf.html)

```{code-cell} ipython3
#a) Time script
%time
X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(10), np.arange(10)) #Using the linked documentation 
A_99 = X * Y

A_99_reshape = np.reshape(A_99, 100) #array of evenly spaced values 

#b) Mean calculation
summation = np.sum(A_99_reshape) #sum of array
length = len(A_99_reshape) #length of array
mean = summation/length #mean
print(mean)

#c) Standard deviation calculation
square = [] #all of the values minus the mean squared
for i in A_99:
    combine = (i - mean)**2 #values minus the mean squared
    square.append(combine)
total = np.sum(square)/length #sums all the squares
standard_deviation = math.sqrt(total) #calculation of standard deivation 
print(standard_deviation)

#d) Filled Contour Plot
plt.contourf(X, Y, A_99) #from provided documentation
```

The mean of the data is 20.25 and the standard deviation is 20.05. The filled contour plot is shown above.

4. The following linear interpolation function has an error. It is supposed to return y(x) given the the two points $p_1=[x_1,~y_1]$ and $p_2=[x_2,~y_2]$. Currently, it just returns and error.

```python
def linInterp(x,p1,p2):
    '''linear interplation function
    return y(x) given the two endpoints 
    p1=np.array([x1,y1])
    and
    p2=np.array([x2,y2])'''
    slope = (p2[2]-p1[2])/(p2[1]-p1[1])
    
    return p1[2]+slope*(x - p1[1])
```

+++

# Revision is made here to test function

```{code-cell} ipython3
#4) cCorrected interpolation function
def linInterp(x,p1,p2):
    '''linear interplation function
    return y(x) given the two endpoints 
    p1=np.array([x1,y1])
    and
    p2=np.array([x2,y2])'''
    slope = (p2[1]-p1[1])/(p2[0]-p1[0]) #indices need to be in range. The indiced of a two-item list are 0 and 1
    
    return p1[1]+slope*(x - p1[0])
p1 = [7, 7]
p2 = [4, 4]
x = 2
linInterp(x, p1, p2)
```

The problem with this interpolation function was that the indices indicated were out of range. By changing the indices to 1 and 0 the indicies are now in range and can be used in the function.

## Problems [Part 3](03_Numerical_error.md)

1. The growth of populations of organisms has many engineering and scientific applications. One of the simplest
models assumes that the rate of change of the population p is proportional to the existing population at any time t:

$\frac{dp}{dt} = k_g p$

where $t$ is time in years, and $k_g$ is growth rate in \[1/years\]. 

The world population has been increasing dramatically, let's make a prediction based upon the [following data](https://worldpopulationhistory.org/map/2020/mercator/1/0/25/) saved in [world_population_1900-2020.csv](../data/world_population_1900-2020.csv):


|year| world population |
|---|---|
|1900|1,578,000,000|
|1950|2,526,000,000|
|2000|6,127,000,000|
|2020|7,795,482,000|

a. Use a growth rate of $k_g=0.013$ [1/years] and compare the analytical solution (use initial condition p(1900) = 1578000000) to the Euler integration for time steps of 20 years from 1900 to 2020 (Hint: use method (1)- plot the two solutions together with the given data) 

b. Discussion question:Â If you decrease the time steps further and the solution converges, will it converge to the actual world population? Why or why not? 

**Note: We have used a new function `np.loadtxt` here. Use the `help` or `?` to learn about what this function does and how the arguments can change the output. In the next module, we will go into more details on how to load data, plot data, and present trends.**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
year, pop = np.loadtxt('../data/world_population_1900-2020.csv',skiprows=1,delimiter=',',unpack=True)
print('years=',year)
print('population =', pop)
```

#3a) Using the textbook/notebooks provided, I have formulated the analytical and numerical solutions of the growth rate and then plotted them together.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print('average population changes 1900-1950, 1950-2000, 2000-2020')
print((pop[1:] - pop[0:-1])/(year[1:] - year[0:-1]))
print('average growth of 1900 - 2020')
print(np.mean((pop[1:] - pop[0:-1])/(year[1:] - year[0:-1])))

#3a).Comparison of the Analytical Solution and the Euler Integration Numerical Solution
t = np.linspace(1900, 2020, 20) #array from 1900 to 2020 with time step 20
k_g = 0.013 #growth rate
#print(pop[0])
def analytical_solution(t): #function to solve for analytical solution
    '''mathetical calcultion of the population rate'''
    return pop[0] * np.exp(k_g * (t - 1900)) #calculation of rate is the intial value times growth and change in time
    
numerical_solution = np.zeros(len(t)) #array of zeros
numerical_solution[0] = pop[0] #first element 
for i in range(0, len(t)-1): 
    numerical_solution[i+1]= numerical_solution[i]+ k_g*numerical_solution[i]*(t[2]-t[1]) #numerical calcualtion of growth rate by multiplying by growth rate and change in time which is equaivalent to (t - 1900)
plt.title('Analytical vs. Numerical')
plt.plot(t, analytical_solution(t), '-', label='analytical')
plt.plot(t, numerical_solution, 'o-',label='numerical')
plt.plot(year, pop)
plt.legend()
```

# A revision is made here to answer question 1b more accurately

#3b). I plotted the given data on the graph above(indicated by green line) to see how both lines will converge. The results will approach and converge to the analytical results as the time step decreases. This is seen from the green and blue line above. However, as the time step decreases, the results will not approach the actual population as depicted by the yellow line.

+++

__d.__ As the number of time steps increases, the Euler approximation approaches the analytical solution, not the measured data. The best-case scenario is that the Euler solution is the same as the analytical solution.

+++

2. In the freefall example you used smaller time steps to decrease the **truncation error** in our Euler approximation. Another way to decrease approximation error is to continue expanding the Taylor series. Consider the function f(x)

    $f(x)=e^x = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+...$

    We can approximate $e^x$ as $1+x$ (first order), $1+x+x^2/2$ (second order), and so on each higher order results in smaller error. 
    
    a. Use the given `exptaylor` function to approximate the value of exp(1) with a second-order Taylor series expansion. What is the relative error compared to `np.exp(1)`?
    
    b. Time the solution for a second-order Taylor series and a tenth-order Taylor series. How long would a 100,000-order series take (approximate this, you don't have to run it)
    
    c. Plot the relative error as a function of the Taylor series expansion order from first order upwards. (Hint: use method (4) in the comparison methods from the "Truncation and roundoff error accumulation in log-log plot" figure)

```{code-cell} ipython3
from math import factorial
def exptaylor(x,n):
    '''Taylor series expansion about x=0 for the function e^x
    the full expansion follows the function
    e^x = 1+ x + x**2/2! + x**3/3! + x**4/4! + x**5/5! +...'''
    if n<1:
        print('lowest order expansion is 0 where e^x = 1')
        return 1
    else:
        ex = 1+x # define the first-order taylor series result
        for i in range(1,n):
            ex+=x**(i+1)/factorial(i+1) # add the nth-order result for each step in loop
        return ex
        
```

Below I have determing the approxiamtion of the series and the actual calculation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
#d2a) Relative Error Between Approximation and Calculation
approximation = exptaylor(1,2) #appoximation of the value
calculation = np.exp(1) #actual calculation of the value

print(approximation)
print(calculation)

relative_error = ((approximation - calculation)/calculation) #relative order calculation
relative_error = np.abs(relative_error * 100) #absolute value of relative order and turn into percentage 
print(relative_error)
```

From these calculations, the approximation of the series is 2.5 and the actual calculation of the series is 2.7. The relative error is determined by doing the approximated value minus the actual value divided by the actual value. Based on this the relative error between the two calculations is 8.03%.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#d2b) Time the Solution for Second-Order Taylor Series
%time
series1 = exptaylor(1, 2) #second-order taylor series
series2 = exptaylor(1, 10) #tenth-order taylor series
#For 100,000
series3 = (series2 - series1)/(10 - 2) #slope approximation
hundreth_series_approx = series3 * 100000 #100000 approximation
print(series1)
print(series2)
print(hundreth_series_approx)
```

The time of the second-order Taylor Series is 2.5Âµs and the time of the tenth-order Taylor series is 2.72 Âµs. The time of the 100000th-order taylor series was approximated by takingt the slope of the tenth-order and second-order tayor series. Based on this slope approximation, the time of the 100000th order Taylor Series would be about 2728.5 Âµs.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#d2c) 
n = np.arange(1, 20, 1) #create an array with values from 1 to 20 with timesteo of 1 
N = len(n) #length of array
relative_error = np.zeros(N, dtype = np.float32) #array of zeros

for i in range(0,N):
    t = exptaylor(1, n[i]) #numerical and analytical solutions 
    relative_error[i] = np.abs((exptaylor(1, i) - np.exp(1))/np.exp(1)) #calculation of relative error
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.loglog(n, relative_error,'o') #using loglog to plot error
plt.xlabel('Number of Timesteps N')
plt.ylabel('Relative Error')
plt.title('Relative Error')
plt.show()
```

To make this relative error plot, I did the comparison methods used in the "Truncation and roundoff error accumulation in log-log plot" from the notebook provided. The plot above is what the relative error looks like.
