# 01 - Interacting with Python

These notebooks are a combination of original work and modified
notebooks from [Engineers
Code](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp.git) learning modules.
The learning modules are covered under a Creative Commons License, so
you can modify and publish *and give credit to L.A. Barba and N.C.
Clementi*.

Your first goal is to interact with Python and handle data in Python.
But let's also learn a little bit of background.

>Notes

+++

## What is Python?

Python was born in the late 1980s. Its creator, [Guido van
Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), named it after
the British comedy "Monty Python's Flying Circus." His goal was to
create "an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major
competitors," producing computer code "that is as understandable as
plain English."

Python is a _general-purpose_ language, which means that you
can use it for anything:  organizing data, scraping the web, creating
websites, analyzing sounds, creating games, and of course _engineering
computations_.

Python is an _interpreted_ language. This means that you can write
Python commands and the computer can execute those instructions
directly. Other programming languages—like C, C++ and Fortran—require a
previous _compilation_ step: translating the commands into machine
language.  A neat ability of Python is to be used _interactively_.
[Fernando
Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pérez_(software_developer)
famously created **IPython** as a side-project during his PhD. The "I"
in IPython stands for interactive: a style of computing that is very
powerful for developing ideas and solutions incrementally, thinking with
the computer as a kind of collaborator.

## Why Python?


_Because it's fun!_ With Python, the more you learn, the more you _want_
to learn.  You can find lots of resources online and, since Python is an
open-source project, you'll also find a friendly community of people
sharing their knowledge.  _And it's free!_

Python is a _high-productivity language_. As a programmer,
you'll need less time to develop a solution with Python than with most
other languages.  This is important to always bring up whenever someone
complains that "Python is slow." Your time is more valuable than a
machine's!  (See the Recommended Readings section at the end of this
lesson.) And if you really need to speed up our program, you can re-write
the slow parts in a compiled language afterwards.  Because Python plays
well with other languages :–)

The top technology companies use Python: Google, Facebook, Dropbox,
Wikipedia, Yahoo!, YouTube... Python took the No. 1 spot in the
interactive list of [The 2017 Top Programming
Languages](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages),
by _IEEE Spectrum_ ([IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/about/index.html) is the
world's largest technical professional society).  <!-- #endregion -->

## Let's get started

You could follow this first lesson using IPython. If you have it
installed in the computer you're using, you enter the program by typing
`ipython` on the command-line interface (the **Terminal** app on Mac
OSX, and on Windows the **PowerShell** or a similar app).  A free
service to try IPython online, right from your browser, is [Python
Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/). You can execute
all the examples of this lesson in IPython using this service. 

You can also use Jupyter: an environment that combines programming with
other content, like text and images, to form a "computational
narrative." All of these lessons are written in Jupyter notebooks. 

For this lesson, you should open a blank
Jupyter notebook, or are working interactively with this lesson.  On a
blank Jupyter notebook, you should have in front of you the input line
counter:

`In[1]:`

That input line is ready to receive any Python code to be executed
interactively. The output of the code will be shown to you next to
`Out[1]`, and so on for successive input/output lines in IPython, or
code cells in Jupyter.


### Your first program

In every programming class ever, your first program consists of printing
a _"Hello"_ message. In Python, use the `print()` function, with your
message inside quotation marks.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("Hello world!!")
```

You just wrote your first program and you learned how to use the
`print()` function. Yes, `print()` is a function: we pass the _argument_
you want the function to act on, inside the parentheses. In the case
above, you passed a _string_, which is a series of characters between
quotation marks. Strings will come back later in this lesson.  


##### Key concept: function

A function is a compact collection of code that executes some action on
its _arguments_.  Every Python function has a _name_, used to call it,
and takes its arguments inside round brackets. Some arguments may be
optional (which means they have a default value defined inside the
function), others are required. For example, the `print()` function has
one required argument: the string of characters it should print out for
you.

Python comes with many _built-in_ functions, but you can also build your
own. Chunking blocks of code into functions is one of the best
strategies to deal with complex programs. It makes you more efficient,
because you can reuse the code that you wrote into a function.
Modularity and reuse are every programmer's friends.

### Python as a calculator

Try any arithmetic operation in IPython or a Jupyter code cell. The
symbols are what you would expect, except for the
"raise-to-the-power-of" operator, which you obtain with two asterisks:
`**`. Try all of these:

```python
+   -   *   /   **   %   //
```

The `%` symbol is the _modulo_ operator (divide and return the remainder), and the double-slash is _floor division_.

```{code-cell} ipython3
2 + 2
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
1.25 + 3.65
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
5 - 3
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
2 * 4
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
7 / 2
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
2**3
```

Here's an interesting case:

```{code-cell} ipython3
9**1/2
```

##### Discussion point:
_What happened?_ Isn't $9^{1/2} = 3$? (Raising to the power $1/2$ is the same as taking the square root.) Did Python get this wrong?

Compare with this:

```{code-cell} ipython3
9**(1/2)
```

Yes! The order of operations matters! 

To review orders of operations look at [Arithmetics/Order of
operations](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arithmetic/Order_of_Operations).

Once in a while, the internet [argues over order of
operations](https://twitter.com/pjmdolI/status/1155598050959745026?s=20)

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAmCTOJXsAYqL4r?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="Order of operations Twitter argument" style="width: 400px;"/> 

__Group 1 argued that__:

```{code-cell} ipython3
8 / (2 * (2 + 2))
```

__Group 2 argued that__:

```{code-cell} ipython3
8 / 2 * (2 + 2)
```

The blackboard problem is vague in its order of operations, _prompting
furious opinions on social media_. Its not clear if the divisor is meant
to be the result of $\frac{8}{2(2+2)}$ or $\frac{8}{2}(2+2)$. When you
translate an equation to code, be deliberate and question the result.

+++

##### Exercises:
Use Python (as a calculator) to solve the following two problems:

1. The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. What is the volume of a sphere with diameter 6.65 cm?

    For the value of $\pi$ use 3.14159 (for now). Compare your answer with the solution up to 4 decimal numbers.

    Hint: 523.5983 is wrong and 615.9184 is also wrong.
    
2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $\$ 24.95$, but bookstores get a $40\%$ discount. Shipping costs $\$3$ for the first copy and $75$ cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for $60$ copies? Compare your answer with the solution up to 2 decimal numbers.

```{code-cell} ipython3
volume = (4/3)*3.14159*((6.65/2)**3)
cost = (60*(24.95 *0.60)) + 3 + (0.75*59)
print(volume)
print(cost)
```

### Variables and their type

Variables consist of two parts: a **name** and a **value**. When we want
to give a variable its name and value, we use the equal sign: `name =
value`. This is called an _assignment_. The name of the variable goes on
the left and the value on the right. 

The first thing to get used to is that the equal sign in a variable
assignment has a different meaning than it has in Algebra! Think of it
as an arrow pointing from `name` to `value`.


<img src="../images/variables.png" style="width: 400px;"/> 

You have many possibilities for variable names: they can be made up of
upper and lowercase letters, underscores and digits… although digits
cannot go on the front of the name. For example, valid variable names
are:

```python
    x
    x1
    X_2
    name_3
    NameLastname
```
Keep in mind, there are reserved words that you can't use; they are the special Python [keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords).
  
OK. Let's assign some values to variables and do some operations with them:

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = 3 
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y = 4.5
```

##### Exercise:
Print the values of the variables `x` and `y`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(x)
print(y)
```

Let's do some arithmetic operations with our new variables:

```{code-cell} ipython3
x + y
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
2**x
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y - 3
```

And now, let's check the values of `x` and `y`. Are they still the same as they were when you assigned them?

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(x)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(y)
```

### String variables

In addition to name and value, Python variables have a _type_: the type of the value it refers to. For example, an integer value has type `int`, and a real number has type `float`. A string is a variable consisting of a sequence of characters marked by two quotes, and it has type `str`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
z = 'this is a string'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
w = '1'
```

 What if you try to "add" two strings?

```{code-cell} ipython3
z + w
```

The operation above is called _concatenation_: chaining two strings together into one. Insteresting, eh? But look at this:  

```python
>>> x + w
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-13c8da8dc575> in <module>
----> 1 x+w

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

<!-- #region -->
_Error!_ Why? Let's inspect what Python has to say and explore what is
happening. It helps to read the Error message from bottom, `TypeError:
unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'` to top, `1 x+w`. The
bottom, `TypeError`, specifies what kind of error you experienced. The top
line, `1 x + w`, tells you where the error occurred, line `1`. 

Python is a _dynamic language_, which means that you don't _need_ to
specify a type to invoke an existing object. The humorous nickname for
this is "duck typing":

#### "If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it's probably a duck."

In other words, a variable has a type, but you don't need to specify it.
It will just behave like it's supposed to when you operate with it
(it'll quack and walk like nature intended it to).

But sometimes you need to make sure you know the type of a variable. Thankfully, Python offers a function to find out the type of a variable: `type()`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(x)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(w)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(y)
```

### More assignments

Here you assign a new variable to the result of an operation that involves other variables.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sum_xy = x + y
diff_xy = x - y
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print('The sum of x and y is:', sum_xy)
print('The difference between x and y is:', diff_xy)
```

Notice what you did above: you used the `print()` function with a string
message, followed by a variable, and Python printed a useful combination
of the message and the variable value. This is a pro tip! You want to
print for humans. Let's now check the type of the new variables you just created above:

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(sum_xy)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(diff_xy)
```

## Reflection point
When you created `sum_xy` and `diff_xy` two new variables were created
that depended upon previously created variables `x` and `y`.  How else
can you accomplish this? Could you make a function? Could you combine
the commands in one block as a script?


### Special variables

Python has special variables that are built into the language. These are: 
`True`, `False`, `None` and `NotImplemented`. 
For now, you will look at just the first three of these.

**Boolean variables** are used to represent truth values, and they can take one of two possible values: `True` and `False`.
_Logical expressions_ return a boolean. Here is the simplest logical expression, using the keyword `not`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
  not True
```

It returns… you guessed it… `False`.

The Python function `bool()` returns a truth value assigned to any argument. Any number other than zero has a truth value of `True`, as well as any nonempty string or list. The number zero and any empty string or list will have a truth value of `False`. Explore the `bool()` function with various arguments.

```{code-cell} ipython3
bool(0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
bool('Do we need oxygen?')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
bool('We do need oxygen')
```

**None is not Zero**: `None` is a special variable indicating that no value was assigned or that a behavior is undefined. It is different than the value zero, an empty string, or some other nil value. 

You can check that it is not zero by trying to add it to a number. Let's
see what happens when you try that:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = None

b = 3
```

```python
>>> a + b
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call
last)
<ipython-input-5-bd58363a63fc> in <module>
----> 1 a + b

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
```

### Logical and comparison operators

The Python comparison operators are: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`. They compare two objects and return either `True` or `False`: smaller than, smaller or equal, greater than, greater or equal, equal, not equal. Try it!

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = 3
y = 5
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
x > y
```

You can assign the truth value of a comparison operation to a new variable name:

```{code-cell} ipython3
z = x > y
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
z
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(z)
```

Logical operators are the following: `and`, `or`, and `not`. They work just like English (with the added bonus of being always consistent, not like English speakers!).  A logical expression with `and` is `True` if both operands are true, and one with `or` is `True` when either operand is true. And the keyword `not` always negates the expression that follows.

Let's do some examples:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 5
b = 3
c = 10
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a > b and b > c
```

Remember that the logical operator `and` is `True` only when both operands are `True`. In the case above the first operand is `True` but the second one is `False`. 

If you try the `or` operation using the same operands you should get a `True`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
a > b or b > c
```

And the negation of the second operand results in …

```{code-cell} ipython3
not b > c
```

What if you negate the second operand in the `and` operation above?

##### Note: 

Be careful with the order of logical operations. The order of precedence in logic is:

1. Negation
2. And
3. Or

If you don't rememeber this, make sure to use parentheses to indicate the order you want. 


##### Exercise:

What is happening in the case below? Play around with logical operators and try some examples.

```{code-cell} ipython3
a > b and not b > c
```
