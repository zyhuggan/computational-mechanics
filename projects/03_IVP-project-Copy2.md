# Initial Value Problems - Project

![Initial condition of firework with FBD and sum of momentum](../images/firework.png)

+++

You are going to end this module with a __bang__¬†by looking at the
flight path of a firework. Shown above is the initial condition of a
firework, the _Freedom Flyer_ in (a), its final height where it
detonates in (b), the applied forces in the __Free Body Diagram (FBD)__
in (c), and the __momentum__ of the firework $m\mathbf{v}$ and the
propellent $dm \mathbf{u}$ in (d). 

The resulting equation of motion is that the acceleration is
proportional to the speed of the propellent and the mass rate change
$\frac{dm}{dt}$ as such

$$\begin{equation}
m\frac{dv}{dt} = u\frac{dm}{dt} -mg - cv^2.~~~~~~~~(1)
\end{equation}$$

If you assume that the acceleration and the propellent momentum are much
greater than the forces of gravity and drag, then the equation is
simplified to the conservation of momentum. A further simplification is
that the speed of the propellant is constant, $u=constant$, then the
equation can be integrated to obtain an analytical rocket equation
solution of [Tsiolkovsky](https://www.math24.net/rocket-motion/) [1,2], 

$$\begin{equation}
m\frac{dv}{dt} = u\frac{dm}{dt}~~~~~(2.a)
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}
\frac{m_{f}}{m_{0}}=e^{-\Delta v / u},~~~~~(2.b) 
\end{equation}$$

where $m_f$ and $m_0$ are the mass at beginning and end of flight, $u$
is the speed of the propellent, and $\Delta v=v_{final}-v_{initial}$ is
the change in speed of the rocket from beginning to end of flight.
Equation 2.b only relates the final velocity to the change in mass and
propellent speed. When you integrate Eqn 2.a, you will have to compare
the velocity as a function of mass loss. 

Your first objective is to integrate a numerical model that converges to
equation (2.b), the Tsiolkovsky equation. Next, you will add drag and
gravity and compare the results _between equations (1) and (2)_.
Finally, you will vary the mass change rate to achieve the desired
detonation height.

+++

__1.__ Create a `simplerocket` function that returns the velocity, $v$,
the acceleration, $a$, and the mass rate change $\frac{dm}{dt}$, as a
function of the $state = [position,~velocity,~mass] = [y,~v,~m]$ using
eqn (2.a). Where the mass rate change $\frac{dm}{dt}$ and the propellent
speed $u$ are constants. The average velocity of gun powder propellent
used in firework rockets is $u=250$ m/s [3,4]. 

$\frac{d~state}{dt} = f(state)$

$\left[\begin{array}{c} v\\a\\ \frac{dm}{dt} \end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} v\\ \frac{u}{m}\frac{dm}{dt} \\ \frac{dm}{dt} \end{array}\right]$

Use [an integration method](../module_03/03_Get_Oscillations) to
integrate the `simplerocket` function. Demonstrate that your solution
converges to equation (2.b) the Tsiolkovsky equation. Use an initial
state of y=0 m, v=0 m/s, and m=0.25 kg. 

Integrate the function until mass, $m_{f}=0.05~kg$, using a mass rate change of $\frac{dm}{dt}=0.05$ kg/s. 

> __Hint__: your integrated solution will have a current mass that you can
> use to create $\frac{m_{f}}{m_{0}}$ by dividing state[2]/(initial mass),
> then your plot of velocity(t) vs mass(t)/mass(0) should match
> Tsiolkovsky's
> 
> $\log\left(\frac{m_{f}}{m_{0}}\right) =
> \log\left(\frac{state[2]}{0.25~kg}\right) 
> = \frac{state[1]}{250~m/s} = \frac{-\Delta v+error}{u}$ 
> where $error$ is the difference between your integrated state variable
> and the Tsiolkovsky analytical value.

The solution converges to the Tsiolkovsky equation based on the plot above. The blue and red lines overlap indicating the convergence.

__2.__ You should have a converged solution for integrating `simplerocket`. Now, create a more relastic function, `rocket` that incorporates gravity and drag and returns the velocity, $v$, the acceleration, $a$, and the mass rate change $\frac{dm}{dt}$, as a function of the $state = [position,~velocity,~mass] = [y,~v,~m]$ using eqn (1). Where the mass rate change $\frac{dm}{dt}$ and the propellent speed $u$ are constants. The average velocity of gun powder propellent used in firework rockets is $u=250$ m/s [3,4]. 

$\frac{d~state}{dt} = f(state)$

$\left[\begin{array}{c} v\\a\\ \frac{dm}{dt} \end{array}\right] = 
\left[\begin{array}{c} v\\ \frac{u}{m}\frac{dm}{dt}-g-\frac{c}{m}v^2 \\ \frac{dm}{dt} \end{array}\right]$

Use [two integration methods](../notebooks/03_Get_Oscillations.ipynb) to integrate the `rocket` function, one explicit method and one implicit method. Demonstrate that the solutions converge to equation (2.b) the Tsiolkovsky equation. Use an initial state of y=0 m, v=0 m/s, and m=0.25 kg. 

Integrate the function until mass, $m_{f}=0.05~kg$, using a mass rate change of $\frac{dm}{dt}=0.05$ kg/s, . 

Compare solutions between the `simplerocket` and `rocket` integration, what is the height reached when the mass reaches $m_{f} = 0.05~kg?$

# New Revision 1: Divide all three mass values by m0

+++

I have divded all three mass values by m0 and the new graph with analysis is seen below. I plotted each integration mothod above seperately as well to show that they are similar.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
sol = solve_ivp(lambda t, y: rocket(y), [0, t[-1]], [0, 0, 0.25], t_eval=t)
#I have divded all three mass values by m0
plt.plot(rk2_sol[:,2]/m0,rk2_sol[:,1],'s',label='RK2',ls='-')
plt.plot(sol.y[2]/m0, sol.y[1], 's', label = 'Solve_IVP')
plt.plot(m_T/m0, v, label = 'Tsiolkovsky')
#plt.axhline(y = 227, color ='b', linestyle ='-') #find height, its not needed i was just using it to show the height better
plt.title('Convergence of Tsiolkovsky and Integration Method')
plt.ylabel('Velocity(m/s)')
plt.xlabel('Mass(kg)')
plt.legend()
```

When doing the same integration method for the rocket function, the rk2 method and solve_IVP method converge and overlap to each other but they do not converge to the Tsiolkovsky.

+++

The height reached when the mass reaches ùëöùëì=0.05 ùëòùëî is about 227 m/s. This is found through a graphical approach based on where the Integration Method lies on the y-axis.

```{code-cell} ipython3
m0=0.25
mf=0.05
dm=1
t = np.linspace(0,(m0-mf)/dm,500)
dt=t[1]-t[0]

m_T = np.linspace(0.05, 0.25)

u = 250
v = -u*np.log(m_T/0.25)
```

If we were to change dm to 1 kilogram we would see the graphs converge like the simple rocket function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
sol = solve_ivp(lambda t, y: rocket(y, dmdt = dm), [0, t[-1]], [0, 0, 0.25], t_eval=t)

plt.plot(sol.y[2], sol.y[1], 's', label = 'Solve_IVP')
plt.plot(m_T, v, label = 'Tsiolkovsky')
plt.title('Convergence of Tsiolkovsky and Integration Method')
plt.ylabel('Velocity(m/s)')
plt.xlabel('Mass(kg)')
plt.legend()
```

__3.__ Solve for the mass change rate that results in detonation at a height of 300 meters. Create a function `f_dm` that returns the final height of the firework when it reaches $m_{f}=0.05~kg$. The inputs should be 

$f_{m}= f_{m}(\frac{dm}{dt},~parameters)$

where $\frac{dm}{dt}$ is the variable you are using to find a root and $parameters$ are the known values, `m0=0.25, c=0.18e-3, u=250`. When $f_{m}(\frac{dm}{dt}) = 0$, you have found the correct root. 

Plot the height as a function of time and use a star to denote detonation at the correct height with a `'*'`-marker

Approach the solution in two steps, use the incremental search
[`incsearch`](../module_03/04_Getting_to_the_root) with 5-10
sub-intervals _limit the number of times you call the
function_. Then, use the modified secant method to find the true root of
the function.

a. Use the incremental search to find the two closest mass change rates within the interval $\frac{dm}{dt}=0.05-0.4~kg/s.$

b. Use the modified secant method to find the root of the function $f_{m}$.

c. Plot your solution for the height as a function of time and indicate the detonation with a `*`-marker.

    plt.plot(sol.t[-1], sol.y[0,-1], '*', markersize = 20, label = 'dm = {}'.format(dm)) #gives range of vales

```

We should use 0.079 since we are solving for the mass change rate that results in detonation at a height of 300 meters. This would be the highest star marker on the graph.
