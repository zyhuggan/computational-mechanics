# Step to the future

Welcome to Lesson 2 of the course module "Initial Value Problems
(IVPs)," in _Computational Mechanics_ The previous lesson, [Catch things
in motion](./01_Catch_Motion), showed you how to compute
velocity and acceleration of a moving body whose positions were known. 

Time history of position can be captured on a long-exposure photograph
(using a strobe light), or on video. But digitizing the positions from
images can be a bit tedious, and error-prone. Luckily, you found online a
data set from a motion-capture experiment of a falling ball, with high
resolution [1]. You computed acceleration and found that it was smaller
than the theoretical value of $9.8 \rm{m/s}^2$ and _decreased_ over
time. The effect is due to air resistance and is what leads to objects
reaching a _terminal velocity_ in freefall.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

### Set things up to compute velocity and position

Your challenge now is to find the motion description—the position
$x(t)$—from a function of acceleration. In the [previous
lesson](01_Catch_Motion), you did the opposite: with
position data, get the velocity and acceleration, using _numerical
derivatives_:

\begin{equation}
v(t_i) = \frac{dx}{dt} \approx \frac{x(t_i+\Delta t)-x(t_i)}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a(t_i) = \frac{dv}{dt} \approx \frac{v(t_i+\Delta t)-v(t_i)}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}

Almost every problem that deals with Newton's second law is a second-order differential equation. The acceleration is a function of position, velocity, and sometimes time _if there is a forcing function f(t)_. 

The key to solving a second order differential equation is realizing that if you have the initial velocity, you can use the acceleration to find the velocity after a short interval of time. And if you have the initial position, you can use the known velocity to find the new position after a short interval of time. Let's rearrange the equation for acceleration above, by solving for the velocity at $t_i + \Delta t$:

\begin{equation}
 v(t_i+\Delta t)   \approx  v(t_i) + a(t_i) \Delta t
\end{equation}

Consider our first computational mechanics model of a freefalling object that is dropped.

<img src="../images/freefall.png" style="width: 200px;"/> 

An object falling is subject to the force of 

- gravity ($F_g$=mg) and 
- drag ($F_d=cv^2$)

Acceleration of the object:

$\sum F=ma=F_g-F_d=cv^2 - mg = m\frac{dv}{dt}$

so,

$a=\frac{c}{m}v(t_{i})^2-g$

then, our acceleration is defined from Newton's second law and position is defined through its definition, $v=\frac{dx}{dt}$. 

_Note: the direction of positive acceleration was changed to up, so that a positive $x$ is altitude, you will still have the same speed vs time function from [Module_01-03_Numerical_error](https://github.uconn.edu/rcc02007/CompMech01-Getting-started/blob/master/notebooks/03_Numerical_error.ipynb)_

+++

### Step through time

In the code cell below, you define acceleration as a function of velocity and add two parameters `c` and `m` to define drag coefficient and mass of the object.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def a_freefall(v,c=0.25,m=60):
    '''Calculate the acceleration of an object given its 
    drag coefficient and mass
    
    Arguments:
    ---------
    v: current velocity (m/s)
    c: drag coefficient set to a default value of c=0.25 kg/m
    m: mass of object set to a defualt value of m=60 kg
    
    returns:
    ---------
    a: acceleration of freefalling object under the force of gravity and drag
    '''
    a=-c/m*v**2*np.sign(v)-9.81
    return a
```

Now you use a `for` statement to step through the sequence of
acceleration values, each time computing the velocity and position at
the subsequent time instant. You first have to __initialize__ our
variables `x` and `v`. You can use initial conditions to set `x[0]` and
`v[0]`. The rest of the values you will overwrite based upon our
stepping solution.

You are applying the equation for $v(t_i + \Delta t)$ above, and a similar equation for position:

\begin{equation}
 x(t_i+\Delta t)   \approx  x(t_i) + v(t_i) \Delta t
\end{equation}

```{code-cell} ipython3
N = 100 # define number of time steps
t=np.linspace(0,12,N) # set values for time (our independent variable)
dt=t[1]-t[0]
x=np.zeros(len(t)) # initialize x
v=np.zeros(len(t)) # initialize v

x[0] = 440 # define initial altitude of the object
v[0] = 0

for i in range(1,N):
    dvdt = a_freefall(v[i-1])
    v[i] = v[i-1] + dvdt*dt
    x[i] = x[i-1] + v[i-1]*dt
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a_freefall(-10)
```

And there you have it. You have computed the velocity __and position__
over time from Newton's second law. You can now make plots of the
computed variables. Note that you use the Matplotlib
[`subplot()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html?highlight=matplotlib%20pyplot%20subplot#matplotlib.pyplot.subplot)
function to get the two plots in one figure. The argument to `subplot()`
is a set of three digits, corresponding to the number of rows, number of
columns, and plot number in a matrix of sub-plots.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# plot velocity and position over time
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))

plt.subplot(211)
plt.plot(t,  v, color='#0096d6', linestyle='-', linewidth=1) 
plt.title('Velocity and position of \nfreefalling object m=60-kg and c=0.25 kg/s. \n')
plt.ylabel('$v$ (m/s) ')

plt.subplot(212)
plt.plot(t,  x, color='#008367', linestyle='-', linewidth=1) 
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('$x$ (m)');
```

## Exercise

The initial height is 440 m, the height of the tip of the [Empire State Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building). How long would it take for the object to reach the ground from this height? How accurate is your estimation e.g. what is the error bar for your solution?

+++

## Euler's method

You first used Euler's method in [Module_01: 03_Numerical_error](https://github.uconn.edu/rcc02007/CompMech01-Getting-started/blob/master/notebooks/03_Numerical_error.ipynb). Here you will look at it with more depth. 

The eminent Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler presented it in his book _"Institutionum calculi integralis,"_ published around 1770 [3].

You can understand why it works by writing out a Taylor expansion for $x(t)$:

\begin{equation}
x(t+\Delta t) = x(t) + \frac{d x}{dt}\Delta t + \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\frac{\Delta t^2}{2} + \frac{d^3 x}{dt^3}\frac{\Delta t^3}{3!}+\cdots
\end{equation}

With $v=dx/dt$, you can see that the first two terms on the right-hand side correspond to what you used in the code above. That means that Euler's method makes an approximation by throwing away the terms $\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\frac{\Delta t^2}{2} + \frac{d^3 x}{dt^3}\frac{\Delta t^3}{3!}+\cdots$. So the error made in _one step_ of Euler's method is proportional to $\Delta t^2$. Since you take $N=T/\Delta t$ steps (for a final time instant $T$), you conclude that the error overall is proportional to $\Delta t$. 

#### **Euler's method is a first-order method** because the error in the approximation goes is proportional to the first power of the time increment $\Delta t$.

i.e.

error $\propto$ $\Delta t$

+++

## Initial-value problems

To get velocity and position from the acceleration data, you needed to know the _initial values_ of the velocity and position. Then you could apply Euler's method to _step in time_ starting at $t_0$, with time increment $\Delta t$. This setting corresponds to the numerical solution of _initial-value problems_. 
(Follow here the presentation in [4], p.86.)

Consider the differential equation corresponding to an object in free fall:

\begin{equation}
\ddot{y}=\frac{c}{m}v^2-g,
\end{equation}

where the dot above a variable represents the time derivative, and $g$ is the acceleration of gravity. Introducing the velocity as intermediary variable, you can write:

\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{y} &=& v \nonumber\\
\dot{v} &=& \frac{c}{m}v^2-g
\end{eqnarray}

The above is a system of two ordinary differential equations, with time as the independent variable. For its numerical solution, you need two initial conditions, and Euler's method:

\begin{eqnarray}
y(t_0) = y_0, \qquad y_{i+1} &=& y_i + \dot{y} \Delta t \nonumber\\
v(t_0) = v_0, \qquad v_{i+1} &=& v_i + \dot{v} \Delta t
\end{eqnarray}

It's so neatly symmetrical that it's just asking for a vectorized equation! Combine the two dependent variables into a vector of unknowns, $\mathbf{y}$:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
y \\ v
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}

and write the differential equation in vector form, as follows:

\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{y}} = \begin{bmatrix}
v \\ \frac{c}{m}v^2-g
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Equation (9) above represents the _state_ of the system, at any given instant in time. A code design for the numerical solution that generalizes to other changing systems (or _dynamical systems_) is to write one function that computes the right-hand side of the differential equation (the derivatives of the state variables), and another function that takes a state and applies the numerical method for each time increment. The solution is then computed in one `for` statement that calls these functions.

+++

Study the code below: the function `freefall()` computes the right-hand side of the equation, and the function `eulerstep()` takes the state and applies Euler's method to update it one time increment.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def freefall(state,c=0,m=60):
    '''Computes the right-hand side of the freefall differential 
    equation, in SI units.
    
    Arguments
    ----------    
    state : array of two dependent variables [y v]^T
    c : drag coefficient for object; default set to 0 kg/m (so no drag considered)
    m : mass of falling object; default set to 60 kg
    
    Returns
    -------
    derivs: array of two derivatives [v, c/m*v**2-g]
    '''
    
    derivs = np.array([state[1], -c/m*state[1]**2*np.sign(state[1])-9.81])
    return derivs
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def eulerstep(state, rhs, dt):
    '''Uses Euler's method to update a state to the next one. 
    
    Arguments
    ---------
    state: array of two dependent variables [y v]^T
    rhs  : function that computes the right hand side of the 
           differential equation.
    dt   : float, time increment. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    next_state: array, updated state after one time increment.       
    '''
    
    next_state = state + rhs(state) * dt
    return next_state
```

## Numerical solution vs. experiment

Use the `freefall()` and `eulerstep()` functions to obtain a numerical solution with the same initial conditions as the falling-ball experiment from [Lesson 1](./01_Catch_Motion.ipynb), and compare with the experimental data. 

In [Lesson 1](./01_Catch_Motion.ipynb), you had considered only the acceleration due to gravity. So before you get into the specifics of the effects on drag, leave c=0 so that you have a constant acceleration problem, 

$\ddot{y} = -g$

and our vector form is 

\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{y}} = \begin{bmatrix}
v \\ -g
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

```{code-cell} ipython3
filename = '../data/fallingtennisball02.txt'
t, y = np.loadtxt(filename, usecols=[0,1], unpack=True)
```

You'll need to use the same time increment, so let's compute it from two
time samples. The initial position is the first value of the `y` array,
while the initial velocity is zero. And you'll only look at the section
of data before the ball bounces from the ground, which gives us the
number of time steps.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#time increment
dt = t[1]-t[0]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y0 = y[0] #initial position
v0 = 0    #initial velocity
N = 576   #number of steps
```

Now, let's create a new array, called `num_sol`, to hold the results of the numerical solution. The array has dimensions `Nx2`, with each two-element row holding the state variables, $(y,v)$, at a given time instant. After saving the initial conditions in the solution array, you are ready to start stepping in time in a `for` statement. Study the code below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#initialize array
num_sol = np.zeros([N,2])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Set intial conditions
num_sol[0,0] = y0
num_sol[0,1] = v0
eulerstep(num_sol[0],freefall,dt)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
for i in range(N-1):
    num_sol[i+1] = eulerstep(num_sol[i], freefall, dt)
```

Did it work? Exciting! Let's plot in the same figure both the numerical solution and the experimental data.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(t[:N], y[:N], 's', alpha=0.8, label='Experimental data')
plt.plot(t[:N], num_sol[:,0], linewidth=2, linestyle='-', label='Numerical solution')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('$y$ (m)')
plt.title('Free fall tennis ball (no air resistance) \n')
plt.legend();
```

The two lines look very close… but let's plot the difference to get understand the [error](https://github.uconn.edu/rcc02007/CompMech01-Getting-started/blob/master/notebooks/03_Numerical_error.ipynb).

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(t[:N], y[:N]-num_sol[:,0])
plt.title('Difference between numerical solution and experimental data.\n')
plt.xlabel('Time [s]')
plt.ylabel('$y$ [m]');
```

## Exercise

Create a plot of the analytical solution for y-vs-t for an object that accelerates due to gravity, plot the difference between the analytical solution and the experimental data with the plot above. 

_Hint: remember the kinematic equations for constant acceleration_ $y(t) = y(0) + \dot{y}(0)t - \frac{gt^2}{2}$

+++

## Air resistance

In [Lesson 1](./01_Catch_Motion.ipynb) of this module, you computed the acceleration of gravity and got a value less than the theoretical $9.8 \rm{m/s}^2$, even when using high-resolution experimental data. 

You did not account for air resistance. When an object moves in a fluid, like air, it applies a force on the fluid, and consequently the fluid applies an equal and opposite force on the object (Newton's third law).

This force is the *drag* of the fuid, and it opposes the direction of travel. The drag force depends on the object's geometry, and its velocity: for a sphere, its magnitude is given by:

\begin{equation}
    F_d = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 \rho C_d v^2,
\end{equation}

where $R$ is the radius of the sphere, $\rho$ the density of the fluid, $C_d$ the drag coefficient of a sphere, and $v$ is the velocity.

In the first module, you used the constant $c$, where $c= \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 \rho C_d$.

+++

You can update our defintion for drag with this _higher fidelity_ description of drag

With $F_{\text{drag}} = m a_{\text{drag}}$:

\begin{equation}
    a_{\text{drag}} = \frac{1}{2m} \pi R^2 \rho C_d v^2
\end{equation}

Finally, you can write our differential equation as:


\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{y}} = \begin{bmatrix}
v \\ -g + a_{\text{drag}}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Let's write a new function for this modified right-hand side of a falling tennis ball with air resistance.

+++

##### Note:

According to the International Tennis Federation,
[ITF](http://www.itftennis.com/home.aspx), the diameter of a tennis ball
has to be in the range of $6.54$–$6.86 \rm{cm}$, and its mass in the
range of $56.0$–$59.4 \rm{g}$. Choose a value in the middle of the range for each quantity.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def fall_drag(state,C_d=0.47,m=0.0577,R = 0.0661/2):
    '''Computes the right-hand side of the differential equation
    for the fall of a ball, with drag, in SI units.
    
    Arguments
    ----------    
    state : array of two dependent variables [y v]^T
    m : mass in kilograms default set to 0.0577 kg
    C_d : drag coefficient for a sphere default set to 0.47 (no units)
    R : radius of ball default in meters is 0.0661/2 m (tennis ball)
    Returns
    -------
    derivs: array of two derivatives [v (-g+a_drag)]^T
    '''
    
    rho = 1.22   # air density kg/m^3
    pi = np.pi
    
    a_drag = -1/(2*m) * pi * R**2 * rho * C_d * (state[1])**2*np.sign(state[1])
    
    derivs = np.array([state[1], -9.8 + a_drag])
    return derivs
```

Assume the same initial conditions as before:

```{code-cell} ipython3
y0 = y[0] # initial position
v0 = 0    # initial velocity
N = 576   # number of steps
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# initialize array
num_sol_drag = np.zeros([N,2])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Set intial conditions
num_sol_drag[0,0] = y0
num_sol_drag[0,1] = v0
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
for i in range(N-1):
    num_sol_drag[i+1] = eulerstep(num_sol_drag[i], fall_drag, dt)
```

Time to plot and see how it looks! Would you expect the results to be better than in the previous case? Let's plot the three cases and check the differences.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(t[:N], num_sol[:,0], linewidth=2, linestyle='--', label='Num-solution no drag')
plt.plot(t[:N], y[:N], linewidth=2, alpha=0.6, label='Experimental data')
plt.plot(t[:N], num_sol_drag[:,0], linewidth=2, linestyle='--', label='Num-solution drag')

plt.title('Free fall tennis ball \n')

plt.xlabel('Time [s]')
plt.ylabel('$y$ [m]')
plt.legend();
```

All the lines look very close… but let's plot the differences with the experimental data in both cases, to get an idea of the error.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(t[:N], y[:N]-num_sol[:,0], label='No drag')
plt.plot(t[:N], y[:N]-num_sol_drag[:,0], label='With drag')
plt.title('Difference between numerical solution and experimental data.\n')
plt.xlabel('Time [s]')
plt.ylabel('$y$ [m]')
plt.legend();
```

## Discussion

* What do you see in the plot of the difference between the numerical solution and the experimental data?

* Is the error plotted above related to truncation error? Is it related to roundoff error?

+++

## What you've learned

* Integrating an equation of motion numerically.
* Drawing multiple plots in one figure,
* Solving initial-value problems numerically
* Using Euler's method.
* Euler's method is a first-order method.
* Freefall with air resistance is a more realistic model.
